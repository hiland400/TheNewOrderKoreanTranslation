 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC:0 "괴링은 \"만약 연합군 폭격기가 한 대라도 독일에 닿는다면, 나를 헤르만 마이어라 불러도 좋다!\"라고 한 적이 있습니다. 세계대전에서 국가사회주의가 승리함으로서 괴링의 허풍은 더 이상 허풍이 아니게 되었고, 연합군이 패배하면서 괴링의 명성은 드높아졌습니다.\n\n어찌보면 정치적으로 유능하다 할 수 있는 사고방식과 깡패, 민병대, 그리고 '애국자' 등을 사용해 그의 권력을 방해하는 자들을 몰아내는 것으로 괴링은 군부의 목소리에 진정으로 귀를 귀울이는 유일한 정치인으로서 독일 정계의 중심 인물이 되었습니다. 다른 좋은 집권 방법을 찾지 못한 괴링은 늙은 총통을 '제국이 번영할 유일한 방법은 바로 제국의 적들을 완전히 파괴하는것'이라고 확신하게 만든 제복을 입은 아첨꾼들과 길을 같이했습니다.\n\n이제, 괴링은 많은 사람들이 제국의 패망으로 가는 지름길이라 생각하는 길을 행진하고 있습니다. 그러나 이것은 그가 얼마 안가 망할 것이라는 가정 하에서 그런 것인데, 왜냐하면 괴링이 바다 건너에 눈길을 돌린다면 어떤 일이 일어날지는 상상만 할 수 있기 때문입니다."

The effectiviness of tactic has yet to be proven though, as the reaction of the average German can be contributed to mere shock value and that over time the effect will wear off. For now however, the German army has to account for yet another weakness of theirs."

 GGR_panzer_charges:0 "Panzer Charges"
 GGR_panzer_charges_desc:0 "The succes of the Odin program was originally atributted to the Nazi Ideology and its obsession with old pagan gods. This has been disproven, as the German army took to countering the Swedish singing with their own version: The Fenryr Program. Now, whenever German Panzers ride into battle they will be accompanied by the curses in the old German tongue. While the Average Swede has no fear for the old gods, they do fear an enemy far worse: an onslaught of German Tanks."
 GGR_northern_slave_mines:0 "Northern Slave Mines"
 GGR_northern_slave_mines_desc:0 "Just like the Soviets of old, the German government has chosen to send its political opponents and undesirables to camps up in the north. Here the slaves will work in the mines to keep the German war machine running. Up here in the north the slaves face harsher conditions, which makes revolt more unlikely as they cannot possibly survive on their own. The only problem with this otherwise perfect plan is the Swedish resistance becoming more popular as people start to fear the idea of Sweden becoming a giant slave camp."

The corrupt Judeo-Capitalist Americans humored themselves by calling Germany "the sick man of Europe"; now, they will be reduced to scorch marks by our glorious Luftwaffe.\n\nThe time has come to prepare ourselves.

The militaristic faction in our administration, who have exerted their influence on us for so long are currently in total disarray.\n\nMuch of the power they hold has been temporarily stripped thanks to the chaos and upheaval the crisis has caused. The power Schörner and his clique wield at the moment is minimal at best.\n\nThere is no time to waste! Now is the perfect opportunity to put these power hungry bastards in their place! Göring and his allies currently have enough power to remove their rivals from the administration! There is no time to complete this; now is the time for action, and to secure the Reich once and for all for Führer Göring!"
 GER_GOR_the_great_purge_desc:0 "Where there was once a vicious discordance of gunshots and explosions, a dull silence now fills the void. The screams have faded, the dust has settled, and the taste of blood and smoke lingers in the air like a distant memory... but the final body has not yet fallen. Victory everlasting is sweet to the tongue, but there are still toxic elements that threaten to spoil the flavor. Littered throughout the Reich like an infestation of rats hide our most craven of foes, those who foolishly believe that the end of the Bürgerkrieg heralds their safety.\n\nThey are wrong. From the liberal scum who blindly followed the lies of Speer to the Bormannite weasels who protected the corrupt status quo, our Great Purge will spare no traitor. With great aid from Reichsmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and the Wehrmacht, Göring's triumph shall be maintained for years to come!"
 GER_GOR_crack_down_on_the_bankers_desc:0 "Banks are inherently untrustworthy organisations - good Christians were forbidden from usury for centuries, relegating the practice to Jews. While we may have eliminated the Semitic menace from our institutions, it seems some of their practices have rubbed off on those who have replaced them. Many of the bankers threw their lots in with Bormann, sealing their fates. Those which did not would do well to keep their heads down while we deal with the traitors among them - and learn well from their mistakes."
 GER_GOR_nationalize_the_banks_desc:0 "The banks have been allowed too much leeway in their dealings. Foreigners, traitors and fools have all received their funding and it is time we end this wastage. Shackling them to the state will ensure their loyalty, and provide a valuable source of cash to fund our plans for the Reich. We don't need to pay them of course - those bankers left are eager for an opportunity to prove their loyalty."
 GER_GOR_a_bayonet_for_the_bankers_desc:0 "Complacency is what got us where we are now. We were complacent with the students, with the bankers, with the rest of our party. No more. We will ensure our grip never slacks on the banks, and keep tabs on whoever is left there. They redoubled their efforts when they never saw their traitorous colleagues again - perhaps this atmosphere can be sustained? They are all guilty of something, and removing one every now and again will do a great deal to remind them where their place is."
 GER_GOR_cage_the_students_desc:0 "Germany's universities have been its pride for many years. Countless Nobel prize winners came from these hallowed halls, and some of the greatest technical minds of this century have been German. Time takes its toll however, and for the past decade the Reich's students have been nothing but a thorn in its side. They have turned to discredited ideologies such as democracy and even socialism, and with the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg many Universities rose up as their own statelets. Most, such as Münich and Heidelberg were quickly put down, but those in Albert Speer's territory frequently survived and swore their loyalty to him. While we may have removed Speer from the board, his pawns remain.\n\nThe rubble of the universities is easily picked through. Dig out the students and throw them in a cell. They'll learn the price of their hubris soon enough."
 GER_GOR_round_up_dissidents_desc:0 "There are enemies around every corner, even if there are a few less corners after the war. The Catholic Church has ever been troublesome for us. The Reichskonkordat may have officially stabilised relations with the Vatican but we stopped paying attention to it long ago. Catholics are everywhere in Bayern and Ostmark, and the priests there too often take it upon themselves to interfere in matters that are none of their business. They learned the value of a good speech long ago, and we must make sure they are unable to give them.\n\nBorders become a lot more porous when all the guns are pointing inwards. Smuggling has taken hold in the East and South, with businesses often turning to their counterparts across the border. We might be able to excuse this if it was a temporary measure but their greedy ways have persisted after the war's conclusion. Punishment is in order. All of these traitors will be confined to prison camps until the Wehrmacht decides whether it is worth killing them."
 GER_GOR_a_bullet_for_the_traitors_desc:0 "The war was long and hard fought, and many still are not willing to accept the proper state of things. Heydrich's SS have been dug out but Bormann and Speer's people remain, ready to resume their sabotage at a moments notice. Anyone willing to serve those who would bring the Reich to ruin is an idiot at best and should be eliminated as a hindrance or a traitor and must be eliminated with prejudice. We shall not make the mistake of letting them live."
 GER_GOR_school_militarization_desc:0 "School is where a mind is honed before it enters service. Children are the future, and Hitler was wise enough to see that. The Hitlerjügend was to be our youth's first taste of a martial life back in the thirties, and we need to inspire a thirst for that now just as much as then.\n\nA gruelling time is ahead of us, and our children need to be prepared for that. A greater focus on physical education will prepare them for the wars ahead. Reichsmarshall Schörner himself has recommended we relax grade requirements - it would be cruel to insult the men who will go on to fight on the front line by giving them failing grades, and there are much better things to educate them on. Every week our youth will perform atomic bombing drills - just in case. Duck and cover, children. "
 GER_GOR_and_chains_for_the_thinkers_desc:0 "We may have dealt with this latest round of rebellious students, but what of the next one? And the one after that? It is our duty to maintain discipline in our children. We shall have Wehrmacht guards stationed at university campuses, officers monitoring the lesson plans, and a few thousand Reichsmarks will buy us a disproportionate number of student informants. What else do students have to complain about but money?"
 GER_GOR_faith_in_the_gun_desc:0 "If things have not calmed down, they have at least stopped heating up. Arms on every street corner do a great deal for one's peace of mind, and have restored faith in the Führer's ability to keep things under control, if not his legitimacy. The rebellious voices have been silenced for now, and if we keep a lid on things they will stay that way. All we have to do is maintain faith in our soldiers, our tanks, and our guns."
 GER_GOR_pride_in_the_fuhrer_desc:0 "Führer Göring has done what seemed impossible, and vanquished all pretenders to his title. That evil administrator Bormann; Speer, the architect of the Reich's destruction; Heyrich, the Man with the Iron Heart who tortured and murdered across Europe. If Hitler's faith in him was not proof of his legitimacy then the destruction of all of his foes certainly is. We should be proud of our Führer, who has fought and commanded across Europe since the First World War, and brought victory in his wake."
 GER_GOR_prepare_the_new_germany_desc:0 "Germany proper has once again been stabilised and the traitors and pretenders destroyed. Now it is time for us to reclaim our rightful Lebensraum as we did two decades ago. Thankfully it will be somewhat easier this time, with no Soviet Union to contest our mastery of Europe. Only our former subjects exist to oppose us - the Americans and Japanese are half a world away. And once we reassert our control, we will be ready for them."
 GER_GOR_prepare_the_army_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht was shattered in the Bürgerkrieg, split into four and set against itself. While we may have gained the greatest share, more than half our officers cannot be trusted, and who knows how many enlisted men. A pruning down is required. Further still, the war proved our tactics outdated and our Heer old fashioned. It must be reformed if we are to reassert control over Europe, so that we may crush our enemies, see them driven before us, and hear the lamentations of their women."
 GER_GOR_a_new_age_of_science2_desc:0 "Never before have our generals had such an influence in policy; they did win us the war, after all. Naturally, they expect their opinions to be heard, and lately they've been clamouring for more funding. A few of the more imaginative of them have been digging up old ideas, ideas discarded as "impractical", and "unfeasible", and "too dangerous to sanction". These ideas may not lead anywhere, but it doesn't do any harm to let them dream. Send some funds down to our research departments to entertain them."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_0_desc:0 "Denmark, Ostland, the Netherlands, Bohemia,Poland and Slovakia. Every journey begins with a first step. And the path to restore the Reich's glory lies in securing it's immediate and rightful sphere in Central Europe. These operations have been given the name War Plan 0. Resistance is expected to be futile and miniscule."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_A_desc:0 "Now that the Reich's control over central Europe has been reestablished, the Wehrmacht is already looking to the Balkans, Scandinavia, the British Isles and the rest of our Reichskommissariat in the East. War Plan A will involve securing control of these vital areas through German steel. This shall not only restore the Reich's pre civil war territory, but also bring order to those nations still defying us in the Baltic and the Balkans."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_b_desc:0 "To have conquered the crumbling states surrounding the Greater German Reich was a matter of inevitability. Now the time has come to immortalise the Fatherland's standing in Europe once and for all and crush the vicious powers that seek to destroy us from without. To the east lie the teeming subhuman masses, huddled within the rotting remains of Russia; with just one final push the Slavic hordes will be crushed under the mighty boot of the advancing Wehrmacht. To the south await the scheming Italians, monkeys in suits who bicker and hoot among themselves while undesirables roam free. Only once the Reich claims victory over Iberia and Turkey can we secure a hold on the Mediterranean, and then nothing will prevent Italy from falling just as Rome had centuries ago."
 GER_GOR_five_year_industrial_plan2_desc:0 "We may talk the talk about the renewed Germany, but it's time to walk the walk. Our factories lie in ruins, our streets are paved with rubble and our fields are filled with the dead. We must rectify this before any attempt is made to restore control outside of the Reich's core.\n\nLearning from one's own mistakes is good but learning from our enemies is better. The Soviets had a good idea or two while they were around, and the Five Year Plan is one the Führer in his economic wisdom has set his sights on. Our industrial planners will draw up estimates - how fast can steel production be brought back to pre-war levels? How quickly can roads between supply centres be repaved, how quickly can chemical production be expanded? A deadline makes everyone work harder. "

Under his command Prussian soldiers marched through Denmark, Austria and France, trampling each under their heel and forming the Second German Reich in the process. The war for Schleswig-Holstein in 1864 extended Germany onto the Danish peninsula, and Hitler's Reich put the rest under our supervision. Now, we must finish the job.

The swift capture of the city is vital to crush the Danish will to fight. The Luftwaffe will deliver the Fallschirmjäger from above, while the Seebataillon push onto the shores. While the Danish may not put up too much of a resistance anyway, the sight of a carpet of parachutes falling from above will have any would-be heroes shaking in their boots."

The Danish have always felt a light hand, and their little revolt amounts to nothing more than a declaration of secession. The flat, open terrain of the Jutland will pose little trouble to the Wehrmacht, the Öresund has been patrolled by the Kriegsmarine for decades, and the Luftwaffe face no obstacle to their domination of the skies.

The SS does not deserve these medals as they have never shown any shred of honor or bravery or even strength of any kind. The SS does not deserve any of these medals and these medals would be much better served being melted down into bullets or spoons for respectable veterans to eat from."

Such was such a show of one's strength and their devotion to the fatherland it was something that united the entire nation in one giant parade to valor and nationalism. With the ashes of the civil war fading, we should give one of our most loyal and faithful generals a triumph of his very own. That man, of course, is Ferdinand Schörner. A loyal soldier and honorable and trustworthy man since the times of World War Two. He truly deserves the triumphs as those Julius Caesar had, and he also has been pushing for this for a long time as he puts it. "We should wrap the entirety of Germany into a cult, the cult of valor." "

 GGR_grenadiers_desc:0 "There is a sentiment among many German generals now that we need some behemoth of an army but it should be realized that this is just not logistically feasible! The German Military should be what it always has been and what it always should have been, an elite deadly force of a few honorable, well-equipped divisions ready to set out and die for their nation. If we bloat our army with borderline undesirables then we will end up with a disaster on our hand it has become clear that a Prussian Army cannot be corrupted by weakness and so only the fittest should be allowed to fight for the valor of the Fatherland. "
 GGR_germanies_finest_desc:0 "There were many among the military during the civil war who's acts of strength were not recognized by us at the time and that is truly a shame. Yes, many Germans did fight valiantly to defeat those who wished to corrode the Reich but many did truly extraordinary things. We need to find such Untermensch and give them the rewards they deserve, like perhaps promotions so that our Army will be led by the greatest men Germany has to offer. When we succeed the army will be a true and glorious Prussian army that even the great Fredrick would tremble over! "
 GGR_intensive_training_regimen_desc:0 "Strength and great power are what is in the hearts of every German man but some have more of it than others, thus we need to weed out the weaker ones and elevate the strongest. Our training will be harsh, it will be grueling but it will be necessary. Those who can not deal with this will be tossed aside as they are a better fit in the factories but those who do will be warriors like those of Sparta and those who do survive will be so full of valor and fire that no nation shall dare challenge us ever again. Now is the era of Strength and those who do not adapt will be trampled underfoot! "
 GGR_mobile_support_weapons_desc:0 "Tanks and mechanized units have been a great help to us but we cannot allow these simple tools to get in front of what is truly important. The great infantryman who has shown valor and strength throughout all of the time and to choose these tools of them would make use just as degenerate as the Americans! Mechanized units have proven time and time again to be a strain on our economy and the lack of oil in our homeland means we are dependent on the control of our colonies. Tanks and whatever else should primarily be supported should complement the strength of our infantry and not overshadow them. "
 GGR_knights_of_the_panzerkorps_desc:0 "The distinguished and renown Panzerkorps must be continuously reviewed and modernized if we are to truly succeed in creating a modern blitzkrieg. We will outfit our Panzerkorps division with the finest warriors in all of the German Reich, to ensure our campaigns against the degenerates of the world are successful. These prestigious knights shall be at the forefront of German propaganda, and shall be given various honors commending their bravery and heroics."
 GGR_armor_every_grenadier_desc:0 "In order to restore the image of a proper grenadier division, we must see to it that our tanks shall be fitted with proper armor from now on. While our grenadiers may prove to be great propaganda tools in the eyes of Germany, our efforts will be in vain if they are without proper equipment. To the factories!"
 GGR_legacy_of_the_ghost_division_desc:0 "First in the line of fire, first into hostile land, the elite Panzer division known as the ghost division has gained incredible fame through their oppressive offensive blitzkrieg during the last war. The ghost division has proven the strategic ability of tanks on the battlefield, and we must never forget this if we are to create flexible and dependable armored units. Leaders of the Panzerkorps will be given extended logistical support as well as more freedom to move independently on the battlefield. This way, our tanks shall strike at the enemy with a ferocity and surprise never seen before."
 GGR_volksgrenadiers_desc:0 "In the past few years, it has become apparent to German High Command that simply having superior fire power is not enough to overwhelm and annihilate our foes. We must, in addition to having superior tactics, be able to overrun and crush the enemy with our superior numbers. We shall have reserve divisions for every fighting squadron, so that should a German soldier tire or falter, another proud German patriot will take their place on the battlefield."
 GGR_quality_of_quantity_desc:0 "No matter how many guns we make, we will need a man behind every gun to actually fire them. The wars of the past have proven to us that manpower is a far greater tool than that of superior firepower. By utilizing a larger and more organized army, our forces will be able to tactically overwhelm our foe and achieve our goals much easier."
 GGR_gun_in_every_hand_desc:0 "While our conscription efforts for the army have paid off, it seems as if our armaments production has not quite met its increased demand. We must not allow our soldiers to go onto the battlefield unarmed, and as such decisive action must be taken. Engineers and industrialists from all across Germany shall be convened to determine how to deal with this sharp increase in firearm demand."
 GGR_citizenship_through_service_desc:0 "Our war machine is vast, but it needs more fuel! We can have all the oil, guns, tanks, planes, and food in the world, but all of our material is simply of no use if we don't have the men to utilize it. Fortunately for us, there are ways to "encourage" the population to get them to offer their services to the army without implementing conscription.\n\nWe have decided that the only way Germans can obtain full citizenship (which includes state benefits) is for every German citizen to put in their time in the Wehrmacht. Only real Germans, who serve the Fatherland are deserving of becoming full citizens of the Reich!"
 GGR_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Artillery is the queen of war. She brings great effect to the field, shattering enemy resistance and removing any obstacle that stands in the way of our advance. And should we defend ourselves, it is a remarkable shield that keeps them at bay.\n\nTo preserve the lives of our young men, it is our priority to improve our artillery pieces and to secure better methods at using them. Further work on this branch should aid our army."
 GGR_gun_for_every_meter_desc:0 "A wise Japanese officer once made a comment about the Americans. And he stated that "there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass," should they attempt an invasion.\n\nWhile this demonstrated to us that our former allies in the East considered the American threat with due respect, this must mean one thing to us. If we apply that idea to our homeland, it would be possible. But for every meter of our land, there will be more than just rifles; there shall be stores of ammunition and supplies. And our troops will make any enemy pay with their life."
 GGR_grenadier_panzer_operations_desc:0 "From 1939, everyone has clearly seen the mighty power of the Reich's panzer divisions, and many even regard panzers as the only strength that contribute to our numbers of success in the past thirty years. However, what they failed to understand is, panzer divisions may also find themselves in trouble that they cannot handle on their own, and that's why the Panzergrenadier divisions are created.\n\nWorking with the panzer divisions on the battlefield, the infantries can eliminate the anti-tank defenses alongside all other kinds of obstacles. With proper cooperation, our panzer can reach their full operational capacity during the battle and lead the Reich's other arms sweep into the enemy's heartland with unstoppable momentum. And that's is just the key of our panzer's matchless splendid records."
 GGR_restore_the_armies_grandeur_desc:0 "A long time ago, before the unification of the Fatherland, Prussia was called an army with a state. And from then one, the army become the strongest forces in the world, which led the fatherland toward a united German Reich and brought greatness to our people. Ask anyone about their impression about Germany, and they'll immediately answers the Wehrmacht without hesitation.\n\nHowever, the army itself never get what they deserve, even in the Reich's most glory days. Being old and incapable of leading the country, Hitler tried to subvert the army, not to speak of the reformist traitor Speer's attempt to limit the army's power. No, such attempts will never succeed, for the Wehrmacht is the greatest brunch in Germany, and it will become as strong as the Reich itself. The army has defended Germany through centuries, and it will continue to do that till the end of the world! The restoration of the Armies Grandeur will ensure the Reich's glory in the next Millennium!"
 GGR_rebuild_the_prussian_staff_college_desc:0 "Becoming a general is the dream of every brave child in our nation, but being an officer requires outstanding abilities and qualities and only a few could realize their dreams at the end. To achieve such a dream, one must sacrifice a lot and spend their whole life learning about military. Thus, the old Prussian Staff College must be restored to give them proper education and training so that they can become the eligible officers that the Fatherland need them to become.\n\nAnd beside the education they can receive, becoming a graduate of the Prussian Staff College also means great prestige and fame. Our people will understand how much the officers have sacrificed to become capable protecting them and how distinguished they are. And that's what our generals deserve."
 GGR_cuff_titles_and_new_uniforms_desc:0 "The decline of militarism in the Reich has many deep causes, but one important reason is that, our people have forgotten what becoming generals means and lost their respect toward them. To correct such a mistake, our people must be reminded of the differences between they ordinary people and the generals who protect the Reich, so that they can find their respect toward the generals back.\n\nIn Napoleonic age, the Generals used to wear special and gorgeous uniforms which manifested their nobility and dignity. And now, we can return to that old tradition and hire top designers to design new cuff titles and uniforms for our generals. A fair bird has fair feathers, and the king of all birds must have the most magnificent feathers to make everyone acknowledge his status."
 GGR_end_political_interfearance_desc:0 "For too long , those stupid and selfish bureaucrats have been making absurd decisions and poisoning every aspects of the Reich. And only thanks to the army did we successfully saved the Reich from its enemies within. This fact proves that the general staff has collected the smartest minds in the Reich, and the decisions they've made cannot be disrupted by some lay fools in the government.\n\nFrom now on, the Wehrmacht will become totally independent from all other departments' influence in the Reich. The army as a whole will answer to no one but the Feldmarschall in the world. Oh, and of course, the Führer has the ultimate control of the army after all. At least on paper..."
 GGR_masters_of_the_world_desc:0 "Aryan people are destined to become the master race of the world, and the Wehrmacht will guard us fulfill our own fate. Twenty years ago, we were so close to such a glorious status, but in the end, the internal corruption and decadency stopped us from it. But now, the army have been baptized by the flame of civil war and totally reformed after that. Free from all kinds of political interference in the Reichstag, it will function perfectly and lead the German nation toward greatness. All hail the Wehrmacht, sword of we German nation! All hail Germany, master of the world! "
 GGR_pride_of_the_reich_desc:0 "For anyone in the Fatherland, he should not forget that our Führer is once a fighter pilot in the Second Reich's air forces when he was young, neither should he forget that without him, the Third Reich's Luftwaffe couldn't even exist. When the Reich's fighters fly over the land and smash our enemy's defense, the whole world would say contribute it to the Führer's genius.\n\nTherefore, while we praise the Heer and the Kriegsmarine for their bravery and loyalty, our people need to be reminded that the Luftwaffe is also a pride of the Reich and their trustful guardians in the sky. And most importantly, they will be reminded that who created such an invincible force and that's whom they must respect with all hearts."
 GGR_strike_like_lightning_desc:0 "Fast as the wind and as swift as a soaring eagle, our close air support shall strike at the hearts of our enemies with fear and desperation. Before a counterattack can be arranged, our planes will swoop in and out leaving tremendous damage in their path. Our enemies will never feel a moment of peace, as they will constantly have to worry about an impending aerial assault from our fighter pilots. "
 GGR_higher_faster_better_desc:0 "While our pilots are already considered elite and highly trained, their combat abilities could be further enhanced with better fighters. German engineers must be put to the task of developing faster and more agile fighters in order to better suit our pilots. With the power of German innovation and ingenuity, our enemies will be torn to shreds while we fly higher than we ever have before."
 GGR_destruction_of_nations_desc:0 "Our successful bombing campaigns in Africa and Russia has proved to us one thing: the complete and utter ability for our bombers to rain destruction upon our enemies. They have been left crippled and weak, crawling about like cockroaches too scared to fight. It is pivotal that we continue to develop our bombers in order to ensure our enemies can never fully recover from the destruction left in our wake."
 GGR_barons_children_desc:0 "The Red Baron is considered by many to be the greatest pilot of all time, and as such he has had a tremendous impact on the legacy of the Luftwaffe. Perhaps we could use this influence as a means of recruiting new pilots and help train the next generation of the Luftwaffe. We will implement a program known as "Barons Children" in order to locate distinguished fighter pilots and allow them to recognize their full potential on the battlefield."
 GGR_fighters_without_equal_desc:0 "Time and time again, the Luftwaffe have proven themselves to be the utmost elite fighting force in the skies. Our fighter pilots outclass even the most veteran of our adversaries, showing the world that our pilots are a force to be reckoned with. The Luftwaffe has created some of the greatest pilots in history, and they should be recognized and commended accordingly."
 GGR_knights_of_the_sky_desc:0 "Even the greatest of pilots can have humble beginnings, and by making this clear to the people we can usher in a new era of elite German aces. The German people will no longer see the path to becoming a pilot as unattainable or impossible, but rather as an honorable and worthy position given out to the best and the brightest Germans who are willing to give their all."

 GGR_walkurentruppen_desc:0 "The development of the helicopter transport has proven to be immensely beneficial to our troops on the ground, allowing the rapid relocation of both soldiers and supplies. Perhaps we should further pursue developing this technology, in order to create rapid response assault divisions to further mobilize the German war machine."
 GGR_the_parachute_is_obsolete_desc:0 "As of late, it has become increasingly clear to German high command that the implementation of the parachute on the battlefield is dysfunctional and obsolete. Parachute runs have proven to be far more dangerous than they are worth, and we simply cannot risk wasting German lives on the battlefield. Instead, air assault divisions shall be utilized in order to transport our troops on the ground and to provide tactical support to the Wehrmacht."
 GGR_over_any_ground_break_any_foe_desc:0 "From the dense African jungle to the sprawling fields of Russia, our Luftwaffe shall reign supreme. Regardless of terrain, our fighter pilots will maneuver through the skies to annihilate all those who stand in opposition of Germany."
 GGR_reichsalders_desc:0 "Sworn protectors of the sky, our Reichsalders will watch over us with an undying loyalty to the Reich. Our intensive labor towards improving our air force has finally bore fruit, and our grand air force will guide the German people for generations to come. Our foes may try to retaliate and break our spirit, but they will never snuff out the indomitable light of the Luftwaffe!"
 GGR_deutsches_auslandisches_freikorps_desc:0 "While we have seen the passing of many great military minds in Germany, it is time we begin to encourage those in the Reich who wish to further develop our airforce and refine our flight programs. After all, we cannot properly secure the fatherland without the contribution of every German citizen working towards our cause."
 GGR_strategic_defence_desc:0 "War in the age of nuclear weapons in many ways differs from pure conventional war. If we are to ensure, that the Reich's defensive capabilities are up to the task, then we have to concentrate the existing expertise. Let's found a council dealing with strategic defense. The Nuklearstrategische Rat shall serve us well."
 GGR_repair_the_reichs_defences_desc:0 "While the Reich is littered with Bunkers and underground installations from the World War and the 50's, many of them are either outdated or in varying states of decay or disrepair.If we want to sufficiently protect our people from nuclear attacks and their aftermath, then we will have to restore and modernise as much of these legacy shelters as possible."
 GGR_modernise_the_seigfreid_line_desc:0 "One especially large bunker complex left to rot in recent times are the fortresses of the Siegfried line. Built originally to ward of any potential French attacks on the heart of the Reich, now the line could prove useful once again. With some engineering tricks it can be refurbished to both protect the populations of Alsace, Baden and the Palatinate if a nuclear shelter is needed, but also serve as an additional safeguard against the Burgundians."
 GGR_modernise_the_fuhrerbunker_desc:0 "The Führerbunker was a contingency bunker for use by the Führer himself, should the situation of the Reich ever become desperate enough. Thankfully it so far has not been needed. This means however, that the bunker is just as outdated, as the rest of the Reich's shelters. For a man of Führer Göring's stature, such a meagre housing is of course wholly insufficient. It's time for a modernisation project."
 GGR_crisis_response_teams_desc:0 "To survive any crisis means to be properly organised. And since a nuclear war is the ultimate crisis imaginable, it will need an organisation that can handle this crisis. The Führer has thus decreed the creation of so called Crisis response teams that will prepare and help the German people to survive anything our enemies can throw at us."
 GGR_duck_and_cover_desc:0 "The insidious powers that stand against us, would like nothing more than to destroy our very way of live and our future. Hence every school in the Reich is instructed to hold multiple "Duck and Cover" drills every year. Even our youth will then know how to protect itself from the evil attempts by the Reich's enemies to destroy us with their nuclear arsenal."
 GGR_tighten_atomic_security_desc:0 "The nuclear missile silos are the heart piece of our nuclear strategy. However in the past the Silo's staff and commanders were a cauldron of Speerites, Bormannites or even the SS. This is not a mistake the Führer will repeat. Only the most loyal men handpicked by Göring and Schörner themselves shall oversee such a vital task."
 GGR_new_silos_desc:0 "While our current nuclear silos are sufficient in keeping up the threat of MAD, they are still too concentrated in certain locations and thus we risk being wiped out in a decapitation strike before we can retaliate. Hence building up new and more importantly spread out silo installations in all corners, are vital to the defense of the Reich."
 GGR_new_missile_designs_desc:0 "The nuclear arms race means a constant effort to improve, to overcome and to adapt. Obviously our missiles are no exception to this. A fresh investment into new and improved missile designs will ensure our silos can't be taken out before the missiles leave for the counterstrike."
 GGR_safeguard_the_volk_desc:0 "With our recent efforts the security of our Volk from nuclear annihilation has been, if not ended, then at least mitigated. Our grand investment into both technology and concrete has ensured. The German people rejoice for such a caring Führer, that has taken it upon him to spare them the horrors of nuclear war."
